This is my final project for the promineo tech backend developer course.

It is a Springboot application that allows users to manipulate a satellite database consisting of satellite owners, satellites, and missions, via rest api requests.
An Entity resource diagram can be found at the top level of the repository, and I provided a postman collection export with example requests I used in my final project video (found in src/test/resources).

For a 5-minute video demonstration, see my final project video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FasKhEYiNhY

Thanks,

Ian Fireman
